## Description

A portfolio of work showcasing my skills and talents to potential employers looking to fill an apprenticeship, intern, or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights a persons strongest work as well as the thought processes behind that work. Please note this portfolio contains insight into me and who I am as a professional (About Me), web development projects I built during a full-stack web development course (Projects), data spreadsheets and analysis papers written during my MBA journey (Coursework), my contact details, and link to various resumes.

Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) and current coursework are typically very successful in their career searching. With many companies, having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview.

This portfolio project covered core web development skills such as flexbox, media queries, javascript, and CSS variables. This project also provided the ability to practice these newly acquired skills while creating something that can be used during a job search.
