## Description

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: at many companies, having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview. 

This weeks Challenge will assist Coding Bootcamp student's by setting them up for future success as they apply the recently learned core skills: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. This project will provide students the ability to practice these newly acquired skills while creating something that can be used during a job search.

**Note**: If needed, use placeholder images and names as these can be updated later in the course.
