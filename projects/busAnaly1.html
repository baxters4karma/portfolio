        <h1>Adventure Works Cycles Production Planning Analysis</h1>
        <p>In this project, I used Microsoft Excel to determine the optimal production mix for Adventure Works Cycles' Touring
            Bike models that would generate the most gross profit for the company while satisfying all given constraints. I also
            created a Monte Carlo simulation for the BMX-9000, a new experimental model, to recommend how many units should be
            produced based on the simulation.</p>
        <h2>Tasks Performed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a spreadsheet with formulas and constraints for the Touring Bike model mix</li>

        <p>In this project, I created a dashboard for call center managers at Adventure Works Cycles to monitor progress on
            strategic objectives and key performance indicators. The dashboard was based on a monthly data set extracted from
            the Adventure Works data warehouse and was created using Microsoft Excel.</p>

        <h1>Adventure Works Cycles Data Warehousing and Dimensional Modeling</h1>
        <p>In this project, I used Adventure Works Cycles' enterprise data warehouse to analyze online sales data and find ways
            to sell more products through the company's website. I created a simplified star schema with a fact table and two
            dimension tables, populated these tables with data using an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process, and
            constructed a data cube for analyzing online sales data.</p>

            company's data warehouse: a list of long-term customers with their survey responses and total first-year sales, and
            a list of new customers to be classified with their survey responses.</p>

        <h1>Successfully Implementing a Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence System</h1>
        <p>In this project, I researched the complexities of successfully implementing a data warehouse and business
            intelligence system. My research focused on helping management and executive leaders understand the paradigm shift
            and process changes needed to fully utilize the benefits of these systems. I also covered the effects of pushing
            ERP/BI systems through the implementation process too quickly, resulting in poor utilization and lack of user
            adoption.</p>
