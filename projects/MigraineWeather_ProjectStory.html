<section id="project-summary">
    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>This capstone project delves into the complex interplay between atmospheric conditions and migraine occurrences,
        focusing specifically on the correlation with sea-level pressure changes. The goal is to provide actionable
        insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers through comprehensive data analysis and visualization
        techniques.</p>

    <h2>Project Story</h2>
    <p>My journey in this project began with an exploration of extensive weather and health data. By employing Python
        and its powerful libraries, along with Jupyter Notebooks for thorough documentation, I navigated through large
        datasets to discern patterns and correlations. The project not only involved sophisticated data manipulation and
        visualization but also rigorous statistical testing to substantiate the findings.</p>

    <h3>Problem/Question to be Solved</h3>
    <p>My primary objective was to unravel whether fluctuations in sea-level pressure could be linked to the prevalence
        of migraines. This exploration aimed at enhancing our understanding of environmental factors influencing health,
        particularly in migraine management.</p>

    <h3>Process of Getting to the Resolution</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong> </br> Sourcing data from meteorological and healthcare databases, including
            over 27 million data points on weather patterns and 1.4 million data points on migraine occurrences.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Preparation and Cleaning:</strong></br> Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing using Python to
            ensure data quality and relevance for analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong></br> Employing descriptive and inferential statistical techniques to
            unearth potential correlations between weather patterns and migraine frequencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Statistical Testing and Validation:</strong></br> Using advanced statistical methods to validate the
            significance of the observed correlations.</li>
        <li><strong>Insights and Implications:</strong></br> Translating complex data insights into practical recommendations
            for mitigating the impact of migraines.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Python and its libraries for data processing and visualization.</li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebooks for detailed documentation of the data analysis journey.</li>
        <li>Advanced statistical tools for hypothesis testing and data exploration.</li>
    </ul>
