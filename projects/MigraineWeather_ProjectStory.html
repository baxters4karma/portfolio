    <h1>Correlation Analysis Between Migraine Incidences and Weather Patterns</h1>
    <p>Leveraging Big Data to Unveil Environmental Triggers for Migraines</p>
</section>

<section id="project-summary">
    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>This project explores the potential correlation between weather conditions—specifically sea-level
        pressure—and the frequency of migraine occurrences. Using big data analysis and visualization
        techniques, we aimed to provide healthcare professionals and policymakers with insights for preventative
        strategies against migraines.</p>

    <h2>Project Story</h2>
    <p>As an expert in the intersection of healthcare and data analytics, I embarked on a comprehensive study to
        understand the external environmental factors that influence migraine patterns. This analysis navigated
        through complex datasets, employing advanced statistical methods to derive meaningful conclusions.</p>

    <h3>Problem/Question to be Solved</h3>
    <p>Is there a significant correlation between average sea-level pressure and the prevalence of migraines
        across different geographic locations?</p>

    <h3>Process of Getting to the Resolution</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction to the Data:</strong> Acquired and consolidated data from meteorological and
            healthcare databases.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Performed rigorous data cleaning to ensure accuracy in the
            subsequent analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Analyzed data trends and patterns to identify
            potential correlations.</li>
        <li><strong>Statistical Testing:</strong> Conducted hypothesis testing to validate the significance of
            the findings.</li>
        <li><strong>Insights and Implications:</strong> Translated data insights into actionable recommendations
            for stakeholders.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Python and its libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data processing and visualization
        </li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebooks for documenting the data analysis process</li>
        <li>Statistical software for hypothesis testing and regression analysis</li>
    </ul>
