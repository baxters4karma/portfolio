        <h2>Project Story</h2>
        <p>Adventure Works Cycles, a multinational bicycle manufacturing company, is looking to expand its market share
            by targeting high-volume customers, increasing product availability on the web, and reducing production
            costs. As a data analyst hired by Adventure Works, my task was to analyze three years of sales and cost data
            using Microsoft Excel. By doing so, I aimed to provide valuable insights and recommendations to support the
            company's growth strategies.</p>
